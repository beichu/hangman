Welcome to my rendition of a classic word-guessing game, Hangman. Rest assured, no actual hangman is involved! I built this game as a hobby project, but also I'm hoping to showcase some of my programming skills and creativity.

#### Key features:
- Dynamic word selection: Words are randomly chosen via the [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home), ensuring no two game are the same.
- Hint Feature: Stuck on a word? The hint feature provides a definition, striking a balance between challenge and accessibility. Word definations are retrieved from the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
- HTML5 Canvas Graphics: The game's visuals, including the hangman and gallows, are dynamically drawn using the HTML5 canvas element.
#### Technology Stack:

- Python: Game logic is implemented in Python, utilizing [Brython](https://brython.info/) to enable Python code execution in the browser.
- HTML and CSS: The user interface is crafted using HTML and CSS, with a simple, minimalistic design that resizes dynamically.
- Third-Party APIs: Integration of external APIs enhances the game features and user experience.
